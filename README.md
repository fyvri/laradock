`laradock` is a Docker Compose-based solution that allows you to run Laravel applications using `PHP-FPM` and `Nginx`. It is designed to be highly flexible, enabling you to customize the environment to meet the unique needs of your project. Whether you need to adjust ports, select specific PHP versions, or add additional tools and services, `laradock` makes it easy to create a development environment that works seamlessly for you.

**Key Features**

- Customizable Ports: You can configure any port for your application to fit your network setup, ensuring compatibility with your existing infrastructure.
- Flexible PHP Versions: Choose from a wide range of PHP versions available in the [official PHP image repository](https://hub.docker.com/_/php/tags?name=-fpm-alpine), allowing you to match the exact version required by your project.
- Extendable Environment: Easily add additional packages such as `bash`, `yarn`, or custom PHP extensions to tailor the environment to your needs.
- Nginx Customization: Modify Nginx configurations to suit your Laravel application, including SSL settings, rewrite rules, and other customizations.
- Customize Services: Add any additional services like `MySQL`, `Redis`, or any other dependencies your project may require.

For detailed instructions on how to customize your environment, refer to the following documentation:

- App Image: [`src/app/scripts/README.md`](./src/app/scripts/README.md)
- Web Image: [`src/web/scripts/README.md`](./src/web/scripts/README.md)
- Custom Services: [`src/custom/README.md`](./src/custom/README.md)

By following these resources, you can easily configure the development environment to match your precise needs, ensuring a streamlined and efficient Laravel development experience.

> [!IMPORTANT]

> New features will be added over time! Currently, it **ONLY** supports **Linux**, but I‚Äôd love to expand it to macOS too. If you‚Äôre interested in helping it grow, your support could even help me save up for a MacBook üíª to make that happen ‚Äî _but only if you‚Äôre definitely able to!_ üòä üéâ

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1.  Clone the Repository:

    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:fyvri/laradock.git
    ```

2.  Add `laradock` to Your `$PATH`:

    ```sh
    sudo ln -s $(pwd)/laradock/bin/laradock.sh /usr/local/bin/laradock
    ```

3.  Verify the Installation:

    ```sh
    which laradock
    ```

    _This should output the location where laradock is installed (e.g., /usr/local/bin/laradock)._

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure you have [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed and can run the `docker compose` command before proceeding.

## üçª Setup

- **App Image**

  The `app` image serves as the core environment for running your Laravel application and is built upon the `php:${version}-fpm-alpine` image. By default, the `app` image will install the following packages:

  - `composer`
  - `curl`
  - `freetype-dev`
  - `libjpeg-turbo-dev`
  - `libzip-dev`

  Additionally, the `app` image will install several PHP extensions by default, including:

  - `bcmath`
  - `gd`
  - `mbstring`
  - `opcache`
  - `pdo_mysql`
  - `zip`

  However, you have the flexibility to customize the image by adding any extra packages or dependencies that your app requires. You can do this by creating custom scripts in the `src/app/scripts/` directory. For detailed instructions on how to achieve this, please follow the steps outlined [here](./src/app/scripts/README.md).

- **Web Image**

  The `web` image is based on the `nginx:stable-alpine` image. It comes pre-configured to run `Nginx` and apply the necessary configurations for your app. However, if you need to add extra packages or replace the default Nginx configuration, you are free to modify it. To learn how to customize the `web` image, refer to the instructions provided [here](./src/web/scripts/README.md).

- **Custom Services**

  `laradock` allows you to design and customize your environment to include any services your project may require, such as `MySQL`, `Redis`, or any other dependencies. The system is pre-configured to automatically detect and process Docker Compose files that follow a specific naming convention, requiring these files to end with the `.docker-compose.yml` extension. For a step-by-step guide on how to customize your environment and configure these services, refer to the detailed documentation [here](./src/custom/README.md).

## üöÄ Usage

1.  Initialize:

    Navigate to your project directory and run the following command to initialize:

    ```sh
    laradock init
    ```

    _This command will prompt you for the project name, port, and PHP version. The Docker Compose settings will be saved in the `.laradock` directory._

2.  Build and Start Services:

    ```sh
    laradock compose
    ```

    _For more commands and options, run `laradock --help`._
